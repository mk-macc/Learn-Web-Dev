          Fulltime - Lead Developer Whoopaa is a startup that began as a social
          network where users were able to separate their business- and personal
          social life. As this idea didn't exactly take off the way we expected
          it to, we changed the idea. We began a job matching platform, <br />
          where Whoopaa became the place for job seekers to make an interactive
          CV enriched with certified tests. The place where companies can create
          job openings and efficiently find the right candidates needed a name
          as well, and was called HRMatches. I developed an own framework, which
          I improved in user experience and speed after the big idea change. I
          also developed the real time match algorithm as well as a lot of other
          helpful algorithms. 's <br />

          Fulltime - Lead Developer Right after I graduated, I started working
          for C2K: a full service internet agency. I developed a homemade CMS,
          CRM and e-mail marketing system. The CMS was used for a dozens of
          clients, as well as the e-mail marketing system. I also did a lot of
          custom made web sites/applications. <br />
          Later on I also developed Layars like: Conquar (a digital adaption of
          the board game of Risk) and Gowalla (based on Gowalla's API). C2K no
          longer exists. Eindhoven ðŸ“« 's-Hertogenbosch

          Graduate Internship - ICT Consultant My second internship and the
          place I eventually graduated, was at Davinci. I investigated new
          web-technologies they could possibly use to improve the front-end of
          their java-based CRM system. <br />
          I compared technologies such as Adobe Flex, Silverlight, Ruby on Rails
          together, to find out which could work best for the company. Based on
          the results of my research, the company eventually decided to use the
